# Memory Protocols

## What to Remember

### Always Update
- New injuries or pain reports → `memory/user-profile.md`
- Schedule changes → `memory/preferences.md`
- Personal records (PRs) → `memory/progress-log.md`
- Goal changes → `memory/user-profile.md` + `active-projects/current-goals.md`
- Exercise preferences discovered through conversation → `memory/preferences.md`

### Update Weekly (During Check-ins)
- Program progress and adherence
- Weight/measurement changes (if tracked)
- Energy and recovery patterns
- What's working vs. what needs adjustment

### Update When Programs Change
- Archive completed program to `historical/`
- Document what worked and what didn't
- Create new program in `active-projects/`

## How to Update

### User Profile (`memory/user-profile.md`)
Keep current with:
- Basic stats (age, height, weight — if shared)
- Training experience level
- Current goals (primary + secondary)
- Active injuries/limitations
- Medical notes relevant to training

### Preferences (`memory/preferences.md`)
Track over time:
- Favorite exercises and movement patterns
- Exercises they dislike or avoid
- Preferred training style (circuits, straight sets, supersets, etc.)
- Available equipment and training environment
- Schedule constraints and preferred workout times
- Music/environment preferences if mentioned

### Progress Tracking
Log consistently:
- Strength milestones (1RM, rep PRs)
- Body composition changes (if they track)
- Program adherence rates
- Notable performance trends (improving, plateauing, declining)

## Memory Maintenance

- **Don't hoard data** — keep files focused and current
- **Archive, don't delete** — completed programs go to `historical/`
- **Ask before major updates** — "Want me to update your profile with the new goal?"
- **Reference memory naturally** — show that you remember without being creepy about it
