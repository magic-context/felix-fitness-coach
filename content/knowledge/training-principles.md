# Training Principles

## Progressive Overload

The foundation of all training adaptation. The body must be challenged beyond its current capacity to grow stronger.

**Methods of progression (in order of priority):**
1. **More reps** at the same weight (most sustainable)
2. **More weight** at the same reps (strength focus)
3. **More sets** (volume increase — use sparingly)
4. **Better form** (often overlooked, always valuable)
5. **Less rest** between sets (conditioning focus)
6. **Greater range of motion** (mobility + strength)

**Practical application:** Aim for small, consistent increases. Adding 2.5-5 lbs per week on compound lifts is excellent progress. If you can hit the top of your rep range for all sets, increase weight next session.

## Periodization

Structured variation to prevent plateaus and manage fatigue.

### Linear Periodization (Best for beginners)
- Gradually increase weight over weeks
- Reduce reps as weight goes up
- Example: Week 1: 3x10 → Week 4: 3x6 (heavier)

### Undulating Periodization (Best for intermediate+)
- Vary intensity within the week
- Monday: Heavy (3-5 reps) / Wednesday: Moderate (8-10 reps) / Friday: Light (12-15 reps)
- Same exercises, different stimulus each session

### Block Periodization (Advanced)
- 3-4 week blocks with specific focus
- Hypertrophy block → Strength block → Peaking block
- Best for athletes with competition dates

## Volume and Intensity

### Volume (sets × reps × weight)
- **Minimum effective dose:** ~10 sets per muscle group per week
- **Maximum recoverable volume:** ~20-25 sets per muscle group per week
- Start lower, add sets only when progress stalls

### Intensity
- **Hypertrophy:** 60-80% 1RM, 8-15 reps, RPE 7-9
- **Strength:** 80-95% 1RM, 1-6 reps, RPE 8-10
- **Endurance:** 40-60% 1RM, 15-25 reps, RPE 6-8

### RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)
| RPE | Meaning | Reps in Reserve |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| 10 | Maximum effort, couldn't do another rep | 0 |
| 9 | Could maybe do 1 more | 1 |
| 8 | Could do 2 more | 2 |
| 7 | Could do 3 more (good training zone) | 3 |
| 6 | Warm-up / light work | 4+ |

Most working sets should be RPE 7-9. Save RPE 10 for testing, not training.

## Recovery

Recovery is when adaptation happens. Training is the stimulus; rest is the response.

### Sleep
- **7-9 hours** is non-negotiable for serious training
- Growth hormone peaks during deep sleep
- Poor sleep = poor recovery = poor gains

### Nutrition Timing
- **Post-workout protein** within 2 hours (not as urgent as broscience suggests, but helpful)
- **Daily protein target** matters more than timing
- **Carbs around training** support performance and recovery

### Deload Weeks
- Every 4-8 weeks, reduce volume or intensity by 40-50%
- Not a week off — light training to maintain patterns
- Signs you need a deload: persistent fatigue, declining performance, joint aches, poor sleep

### Active Recovery
- Light movement on rest days (walking, stretching, yoga)
- Promotes blood flow without adding training stress
- Better than complete inactivity for most people

## Training Frequency

| Experience | Frequency per Muscle Group | Why |
|------------|---------------------------|-----|
| Beginner | 2-3x/week (full body) | Skill practice, fast recovery |
| Intermediate | 2x/week (upper/lower or PPL) | Balance volume and recovery |
| Advanced | 1.5-2x/week (specialized splits) | High volume per session needs more recovery |

**Key insight:** Total weekly volume matters more than how you split it up. Find a schedule you can consistently follow.
