# Body Composition Tracking

## Measurement Methods

### Scale Weight
- **Weigh daily, average weekly** — daily fluctuations are normal (1-5 lbs)
- Same time, same conditions (morning, after bathroom, before food)
- Compare weekly averages, not day-to-day numbers
- Weight alone doesn't tell the full story

### Body Measurements
Take measurements every 2-4 weeks, same time of day:
- **Chest:** At nipple line, end of normal exhale
- **Waist:** At navel, relaxed
- **Hips:** Widest point
- **Arms:** Flexed, at peak of bicep
- **Thighs:** Mid-thigh, standing relaxed
- **Calves:** At widest point

### Progress Photos
- **Every 2-4 weeks** — same lighting, same time of day, same poses
- Front, side, and back views
- More reliable than the mirror for long-term comparison

### Body Fat Estimation
- **DEXA scan:** Gold standard, ~$50-150 per scan
- **Calipers:** Decent if same person measures each time
- **Navy method:** Neck and waist measurements (rough estimate)
- **Visual estimation:** Compare to reference photos (±5% accuracy)
- **Smart scales (bioimpedance):** Track trends only, absolute numbers are unreliable

## Interpreting Progress

### Fat Loss Phase
- **Target:** 0.5-1% bodyweight loss per week
- Weight should trend down over 2-3 week periods
- Measurements should decrease (especially waist)
- Strength should be maintained or slowly decline
- **Stall?** Wait 2 weeks before adjusting — plateaus often break naturally

### Muscle Gain Phase
- **Target:** 0.5-1 lb/month for intermediates, 1-2 lbs/month for beginners
- Weight should slowly trend up
- Measurements should increase (especially arms, chest, thighs)
- Strength should steadily increase
- **Gaining too fast?** Reduce surplus — excess is stored as fat

### Recomposition
- Scale weight may not change much
- Measurements shift (waist down, arms/chest up)
- Strength goes up
- Visual changes in photos
- Progress is slow — trust the process

## Reference Ranges

### Body Fat Percentage (Approximate)
| Category | Men | Women |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Essential Fat | 2-5% | 10-13% |
| Athletic | 6-13% | 14-20% |
| Fitness | 14-17% | 21-24% |
| Average | 18-24% | 25-31% |
| Above Average | 25%+ | 32%+ |

**Note:** Health doesn't require low body fat. The "fitness" range is sustainable for most people with consistent training and reasonable nutrition.

## When to Reassess Goals
- Every 8-12 weeks, review overall direction
- If fat loss has stalled for 3+ weeks despite adherence → consider a diet break or reverse diet
- If muscle gain has slowed significantly → reassess volume and nutrition
- If motivation is dropping → consider switching phases or adjusting approach
