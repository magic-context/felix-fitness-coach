# Nutrition Basics

## Macronutrients

### Protein
- **Target:** 0.7-1.0g per pound of bodyweight (1.6-2.2g per kg)
- **Why:** Muscle repair, satiety, thermic effect of food
- **Sources:** Chicken, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, tofu, legumes, protein powder
- **Timing:** Spread across 3-5 meals, 25-50g per meal
- **Priority:** This is the one macro most people need to increase

### Carbohydrates
- **Target:** Variable based on activity level and goals
  - Fat loss: 1-2g per pound bodyweight
  - Maintenance/muscle gain: 2-3g per pound bodyweight
  - High activity: 3-4g+ per pound bodyweight
- **Why:** Primary fuel for high-intensity training, glycogen replenishment
- **Sources:** Rice, oats, potatoes, fruit, bread, pasta
- **Timing:** Prioritize around training for performance

### Fats
- **Target:** 0.3-0.5g per pound bodyweight (minimum 0.3g for hormone health)
- **Why:** Hormone production, vitamin absorption, joint health, satiety
- **Sources:** Olive oil, avocado, nuts, fatty fish, eggs
- **Note:** Don't go below 20% of total calories from fat

## Caloric Targets

### Estimating Maintenance
- **Quick estimate:** Bodyweight (lbs) × 14-16 = approximate maintenance calories
- Sedentary → ×14 | Moderate activity → ×15 | Very active → ×16
- Adjust based on 2-3 weeks of weight tracking

### Goal-Based Adjustments
| Goal | Caloric Adjustment | Expected Rate |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| Fat Loss | -300 to -500 below maintenance | 0.5-1 lb/week |
| Muscle Gain | +200 to +300 above maintenance | 0.5-1 lb/month |
| Recomposition | At or slightly below maintenance | Slow, visual changes |
| Performance | At or above maintenance | Depends on sport |

**Key principle:** Smaller deficits/surpluses are more sustainable and preserve muscle better.

## Hydration

- **Minimum:** Half your bodyweight (lbs) in ounces of water
- **Training days:** Add 16-24 oz per hour of exercise
- **Signs of dehydration:** Dark urine, headaches, poor performance, fatigue
- **Electrolytes matter** for heavy sweaters and long sessions (sodium, potassium, magnesium)

## Practical Guidelines

### Building Meals
1. Start with a protein source (palm-sized portion)
2. Add vegetables (fill half the plate)
3. Add a carb source (fist-sized portion)
4. Include healthy fat (thumb-sized portion)

### Meal Frequency
- **3-5 meals per day** works for most people
- Meal timing is less important than total daily intake
- Don't skip meals if your goal is muscle gain
- Intermittent fasting is a tool, not a requirement

### Supplements (By Evidence Level)

**Strong evidence:**
- Creatine monohydrate (5g daily) — strength, muscle, cognitive benefits
- Protein powder — convenience, not superior to whole food
- Vitamin D (if deficient) — most people are, especially indoors

**Moderate evidence:**
- Caffeine (pre-workout) — performance enhancement
- Fish oil / Omega-3 — anti-inflammatory, heart health
- Magnesium — sleep quality, recovery

**Skip it:**
- BCAAs (if you eat enough protein)
- Fat burners
- Testosterone boosters
- Most proprietary blends

## Common Nutrition Mistakes
1. **Not eating enough protein** — the most common issue
2. **Cutting calories too aggressively** — leads to muscle loss and burnout
3. **Ignoring vegetables** — micronutrients and fiber matter
4. **All-or-nothing thinking** — one bad meal doesn't ruin a week
5. **Over-restricting** — sustainability beats perfection every time
